# Setup

In order to start contributing to SpeciesWeb you need some prerequisites installed.

The project primarily uses Docker for local development. Install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/).

A text editor or IDE is highly recommended. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is best, but if you want to use an IDE [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is an alternative reccomendation. This guide only supports setup for VSCode.

If you are new to using Python. It is very trivial to learn if you have programming experience. It might help to make a simple program or two (like a calculator) to learn it. [Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/) is a good reference.

If/once you are already familiar with Python, then proceed to follow the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/) to get quickly up to speed with the framework. It is **highly** recommended you go through the tutorial if you are new to Django, it will help you understand many of the concepts used.
